There is enough space along the river for a maximum of 3 units.\\nThe electricity generated from this source could be used to power the dairy farm equipment, electric space heaters, electric water boilers, and electronics across the marae.\\nWhy not more?\nThe size of a river determines the size of a turbine unit, as well as how many units can be installed. To minimise impact on the river’s health, only 3 units can be installed, and they are relatively small units to accommodate the narrowness of this river. Additionally, excess electricity from the turbines can be temporarily stored in batteries. But to efficiently use this energy, daily hydroelectric energy production should not be greater than the daily energy demand of the community.",
